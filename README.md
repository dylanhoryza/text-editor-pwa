# text-editor-pwa
## Description
- My motivation for this project was to further my knowledge of progressive web apps and how to use webpack.config.
- I built this application to have an advanced text editor that can be installed as a standalone app.
- This application solves the problem of having a text editor that can work offline and save your inputs until the next time you are online.
- What did you learn?
